# Proto Nano

This is an Arduino Nano clone I made in late May 2018. It was pretty
much solely designed so that I could learn KiCad and SMD soldering, but
I also kind of wanted an Arduino made in KiCad anyway. This one has its
problems, though, so I'll make a new one in the future that addresses
these. Problems include, but are not limited to:

- Poor routing job, leading to far more vias than necessary
- Tantalum capacitors are used, which could be substituted for multiple
smaller ceramic capacitors.
- The QFP chip could be replaced with the QFN equivalent, which is
slightly more compact and easier to handle with tweezers.
- I forgot to add tags on the LEDs. The LEDs are, from top to bottom:
RX, TX, PWR, and D13.
